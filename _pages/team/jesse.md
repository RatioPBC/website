As CTO and co-founder of Ratio, Jesse leads the technical strategy for modernizing critical government systems.

During the COVID-19 pandemic, he worked with the New York and New Jersey Departments of Health to deliver data integration solutions when rapid, reliable information systems were essential.

Prior to Ratio, he co-founded Watsi, Y Combinator's first non-profit, pioneering technology approaches for mission-driven organizations.

With deep expertise in system architecture and data integration, he helps government agencies transform legacy infrastructure into modern, maintainable systems.

Jesse holds a Bachelor's in Mathematics from Washington University in St. Louis, rides bikes with his daughter to school in Portland Oregon, and climbs rocks when it's not raining.
